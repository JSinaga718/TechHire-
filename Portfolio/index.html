            <h2><em>About me</em></h2>
        <p>I am a highly motivated and proactive individual with other 8 years of experience in the resturant and hospitality industry. My adaptive and problem solving abilities allow me to be an efficient team leader and energetic team member.</p>
                <p>I am also currently a <strong>TechHire student</strong> at Laguardia Community College, and part-time receptioninst at an optometry office.

        <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
        <p><span style="background-color: yellow; border: thin solid red;">Gaining experience from my first resturant job, at Harlerm's Joe's Crab Shack, has allowed me to serve and bartend all over NYC. I have worked in more resturants than I can count; from the tippy tops of North Bronx, the historical parts of Harlem, the hustle and bustle of Midtown, down to young and trendy Soho.</span> </p>
        <p>During my Anthony Bourdain inspired journey, I also recieved an Associate's degree from Empire State College.</p></article>
    
        <article id="hobbies">
        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
        <p>I naturally gained an undying passion for food! Anything with a bit of <strong>hot sauce please!</strong></p>
        <p>With great food, comes great cultures. I also developed a love for travelling. Last year, I travelled to Europe for the first time and have to go back!</p></article>
